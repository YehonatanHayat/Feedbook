Our code in the "main_part_3 branch. 

This repository represents the client side, in order for the program to work we need to simultaneously run the server which is in our other repository.

In this FeedBook page you can create a new user, sign in and then access the feed page and user profile. In the feed page there is content and you can add posts and other actions. Each user can have friends and has the ability to add them, the presented posts in the feed page are the user's, his friend's and other posts from random people. A user can access a different person's profile page.

How to run:

1. Clone the repository

2. Compile the code - make sure you are on the right path and install dependicies

3. Run the server(guide to running is in the other repo).

4. Open the project by running npm start

5. To sign in, first you need to register. Fill in all the fields of new account according to the guide lines. After creating new account enter user name and password to sign in. We used a built in user for entering - name: "football@life", password: "footballislife". 

6. In the feed page there is button to add posts, you can also delete, like, edit and comment on posts. A user can only  delete and edit his own posts. In the top right of the page the is an arrow down button, by clicking on it a dropdown menu appears in which you can change page to dark mode and log out.

 Workflow:  after fully reading and understanding the project, we began working on the web.  We split up the work in which, one started to work on the sign up and one on the feed, each on a different branch. We merged the codes when we needed to access info from the other.
